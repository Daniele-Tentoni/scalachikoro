## Introduction
### Welcome to the city of Machi Koro, the Japanese card game that is sweeping the world.
You’ve just been elected Mayor. Congratulations! Unfortunately, the citizens have some pretty big demands: jobs, a theme park, a couple of cheese factories, and maybe even a radio tower. A tough proposition since the city currently consists of a wheat field, a bakery, and a single die. Armed only with your trusty die and a dream, you must grow Machi Koro into the largest city in the region. You will need to collect income from developments, build public works, and steal from your neighbors’ coffers. Just make sure they aren’t doing the same to you!Machi Koro is a fast-paced, lighthearted game for you and up to 3 friends. Once you’ve had a taste of Machi Koro, this infectiously fun game may have you wondering if the dinner table ever served another purpose other than gaming. They say you can’t build Rome in a day, but Machi Koro will be built in less than 30 minutes!
